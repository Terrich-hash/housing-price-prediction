## üß† Overview

This project predicts housing prices using a dataset containing demographic, geographic, and home‚Äëspecific features. Through cleaning, feature styling, and using regression (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), it generates accurate price predictions.

## ‚ú® Features

- Data ingestion & cleaning (handling missing values, outliers)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (with plots and statistics)
- Feature Engineering (encoded categorial variables, scaled numericals)
- Model training & cross‚Äëvalidation
- Error & performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R¬≤)
- Optional user interface (e.g., Flask-based API)

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn, XGBoost
- **Optional**: Flask for API
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts
- **Deployment**: Docker (optional), Heroku (optional)
